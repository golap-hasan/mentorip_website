Barrister Shaleh Akram Somrat
Head of Chambers, MentorlP
Barrister Shaleh Akram is the founder of MentorIP and is widely recognized for his profound expertise in Intellectual Property (IP) law. His interest in IP law began during his LL.M. in IP at the University of Dhaka, where he published a research paper titled “Use of Future IP Law Mechanisms as a Corporate Political Instrument.” A regular contributor to national newspapers, Barrister Akram has authored numerous articles on Intellectual Property law, including contributions to the prestigious Springer international journal. To date, he has published 14 articles in major national dailies.

Notable among his recent publications is “Preventing Import-Export of Counterfeited Goods through Intellectual Property Mechanisms”, which appeared in The Daily Star on March 3, 2020. Other significant pieces include “Intellectual Property – The Next Corporate Mechanism” (The Daily Observer, November 12, 2015), “Brexit and its Aftermath – A Bangladesh Perspective” (The Daily Observer, August 18, 2016), “Are Software Patents Valid?” (The Daily Observer, January 19, 2017), and “Domain Name Disputes and Cybersquatting” (The Daily Star, May 21, 2019). He is also the author of “The Fundamentals of Legal Drafting and Conveyancing”, a book published by Shams Publications

With his extensive knowledge and experience in legal and corporate drafting, opinion writing, and agreement drafting, Barrister Akram is highly regarded in the field of Intellectual Property. He has successfully filed and registered numerous patents and has a proven track record in navigating the complex processes of Patent, Copyright, Trademark, and Design registrations, as well as in handling IP-related litigation.

One of his landmark achievements was his handling of a complex Patent Appeal that challenged traditional practices of the Patent Office. The case involved an International Patent Application (Patent No. 1OO6093) filed by a Japanese national, which had been rejected due to the expiration of the statutory 21-month filing period under the Patents and Designs Act, 1911. Despite this, MentorIP took on the case, filing an administrative appeal. After extensive hearings on legal points, the appeal was successful, leading to the unprecedented acceptance of the patent, making it the first case where the Patent Department relaxed its strict time limits.

Barrister Akram is also trusted by numerous multinational companies (MNCs) operating in Bangladesh for his expertise in Intellectual Property Rights (IPR) protection. One of his most praised contributions was his work in safeguarding the copyrights of the well-known coconut oil brand “Parachute”. By orchestrating a raid on a secret counterfeit factory, he helped confiscate large quantities of counterfeit goods and successfully had deceptive copyright applications canceled, saving the company billions. His efforts were widely recognized and appreciated by Marico (Bangladesh) Limited.
