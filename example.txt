Who We Are — A Legacy of Excellence in IP
Our story began in 2000, when Senior Lawyer Dr. Qumrul Hossain founded the firm under the name “Law & Legal.” Built on integrity, trust, and deep legal expertise, the firm quickly became known for its dependable full-service legal support and its early specialization in pharmaceutical trademark matters for domestic clients.

A turning point came in 2008, when MD JOYNAL ABEDIN CHAUDHURY (Known as J. A. Chaudhury Reagan) joined the firm. With strong international vision and a passion for Intellectual Property, he reshaped the firm's direction—expanding its capabilities, introducing global standards, and positioning the firm to serve international brands for the very first time.

By 2010, the firm began managing IP portfolios for global companies, marking its evolution from a domestic practice to a cross-border IP powerhouse.

In 2015, Mr. Reagan acquired 100% ownership of the firm and led a bold transformation—rebranding it as “SUPREMEiP Law Firm.” From that moment, the firm shifted its entire focus to Intellectual Property, offering world-class service with unmatched speed, accuracy, and transparency.

Today, SUPREMEiP stands proudly as a premier IP law firm in Asia, operating through direct liaison offices in the UK, UAE, Thailand, Malaysia, and Bangladesh, and working seamlessly with a global network of over 350 trusted associates.


Our dedication remains the same:
Protecting ideas. Empowering brands. Delivering excellence—every single day.
